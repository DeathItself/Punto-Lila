<h1 align="center">PUNT LILA</h1>
<h3 align="center">This is my latest project made with Kotlin. Punt Lila is an app made for finding events in my hometown Terrassa. It won't be something revolucionary but I'm kind of proud of the outcome, taking into account that this is my very first android project. I made it in collaboration with my partner and friend Alfred, we managed to pull out a functional chat (it's not comparable in any way to a commercial one but it's functional). A recyclerview that gets it's data from firebase, some functional notifications, you can create an account to log in, recover your password in case you forget it (in my case it's waaay too often than i would like to admit). It also opens your navigation app (mainly google maps) to show you where the event is taking place. If you have any trouble with my code don't hesitate to contact me and i would gladly help you sort out any problems.</h3>
